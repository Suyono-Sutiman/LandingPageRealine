This will \r\n        increase the likelihood of your website ranking higher in the organic search result pages. \r\n        Search engine optimization helps you reach your target audience when they are actively \r\n        searching online for information related to your products and services. Without SEO, you \r\n        risk losing potential clients to your competitors, because their website is more accessible \r\n        and appears higher in the search results. Grid Marketing can help you improve your SEO \r\n        marketing strategy, thereby increasing the organic traffic to your website. As we work to \r\n        evaluate your current standing and improve your rankings in the search results, your business \r\n        and online presence will grow. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <Row style={{marginTop:'2rem', textAlign:'left'}} >\r\n          <Col xs={12} md={4}>\r\n            <h5><MdAssignment/> On Page SEO</h5>\r\n            <p>\r\n            We will evaluate your current SEO strategy by means of a technical SEO audit.
